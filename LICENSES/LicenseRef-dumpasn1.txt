   You can use this code in whatever way you want, as long as you don't try
   to claim you wrote it.

   (Someone asked for clarification on what this means, treat it as a very
   mild form of the BSD license in which you're not required to include LONG
   LEGAL DISCLAIMERS IN ALL CAPS but just a small note in a corner somewhere
   (e.g. the back of a manual) that you're using the dumpasn1 code.  If you 
   do use it, please make sure you're using a recent version, I occasionally 
   see screen shots from incredibly ancient versions that are nowhere near 
   as good as what current versions produce.  Finally, see the note earlier
   about this being purely a debugging tool and not production-quality code).
